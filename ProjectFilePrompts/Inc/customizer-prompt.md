# Segment Prompt: customizer.php

```
I'm working on a custom WordPress theme for an art portfolio. We're building it in segments.

This segment focuses on: customizer.php

Project context:
- Custom theme with parallax scrolling effects
- Content blocks float over changing background images
- Custom image carousel that handles different aspect ratios
- Need theme options for customizing the portfolio's appearance and behavior
- Want to provide easy customization without editing code

Dependencies:
- Will be included by functions.php
- Will interact with other theme components through WordPress hooks
- Will provide settings used by multiple theme files

Requirements for this file:
1. Create customizer settings for:
   - Theme colors (primary, secondary, accent, text, background)
   - Typography options (font family, size, weight for headings and body)
   - Layout options (content width, spacing, margins)
   - Parallax effect settings (speed, depth, behavior)
   - Carousel settings (transition speed, style, autoplay options)
   - Background image transition settings (fade duration, behavior)
   - Navigation appearance and behavior
   - Footer content and appearance
2. Include live preview support for all settings
3. Organize settings into logical sections and panels
4. Add custom controls where needed for specialized options
5. Include sanitization functions for all settings
6. Add selective refresh support for efficient previews
7. Include proper defaults for all settings
8. Add descriptive help text for each option
9. Implement theme_mod or option storage as appropriate
10. Include proper hooks for extensions

Please create the complete customizer.php file with detailed comments.
