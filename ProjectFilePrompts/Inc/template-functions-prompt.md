# Segment Prompt: template-functions.php

```
I'm working on a custom WordPress theme for an art portfolio. We're building it in segments.

This segment focuses on: template-functions.php

Project context:
- Custom theme with parallax scrolling effects
- Content blocks float over changing background images
- Custom image carousel that handles different aspect ratios
- Dynamic block generation based on media directory structure
- Portfolio items organized as custom post types
- Need to manage thousands of images efficiently

Dependencies:
- Will be included by functions.php
- Will use custom post types defined in custom-post-types.php
- Will provide helper functions for template parts (content-block.php, carousel.php)

Requirements for this file:
1. Create template helper functions for:
   - Retrieving portfolio items and their metadata
   - Generating content block markup with proper attributes
   - Processing and optimizing images for different screen sizes
   - Handling directory scanning for dynamic content generation
   - Managing parallax scrolling attributes
   - Implementing progressive transparency for block edges
2. Include utility functions for:
   - Image aspect ratio calculations
   - Directory scanning and file management
   - Content organization by taxonomy
   - Background image selection and management
   - Responsive layout calculations
3. Add template tags for:
   - Displaying portfolio metadata
   - Creating navigation elements
   - Generating carousel containers
   - Managing block sequences
4. Include proper filters and hooks for theme customization
5. Add appropriate error handling and fallbacks

Please create the complete template-functions.php file with detailed comments.

This prompt provides guidance for creating the template functions that will power your theme's portfolio display capabilities.
