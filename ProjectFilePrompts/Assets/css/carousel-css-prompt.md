# Segment Prompt: carousel.css

```
I'm working on a custom WordPress theme for an art portfolio. We're building it in segments.

This segment focuses on: carousel.css

Project context:
- Custom theme with parallax scrolling effects
- Content blocks float over changing background images
- Custom image carousel that handles different aspect ratios
- Need smooth transitions between images with different aspect ratios
- Need fullscreen navigation capability
- Support for multiple carousels per content block (1-4)
- Must work well on mobile/tablet devices
- Need visual indicator when more images are available

Dependencies:
- Will be enqueued by functions.php
- Will style elements created by carousel.php template
- Should coordinate with portfolio-theme-style.css
- Will provide styling for elements targeted by custom-carousel.js

Requirements for this file:
1. Create styles for:
   - Carousel container with proper dimensions and positioning
   - Image slides with handling for different aspect ratios
   - Navigation controls (prev/next buttons, indicators)

   - Mobile-friendly touch targets
2. Include responsive styles for:
   - Different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Different device orientations
   - Varying aspect ratios
3. Style special states:
   - Hover effects
   - Active/current slide
   - Loading states

4. Include proper z-index management
5. Add accessibility styling (focus states, etc.)
6. Use CSS variables for theme customization support
7. Include print styles if relevant
