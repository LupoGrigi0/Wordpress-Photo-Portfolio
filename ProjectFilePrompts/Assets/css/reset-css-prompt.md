# Segment Prompt: reset.css

```
I'm working on a custom WordPress theme for an art portfolio. We're building it in segments.

This segment focuses on: reset.css

Project context:
- Custom theme with parallax scrolling effects
- Content blocks float over changing background images
- Custom image carousel that handles different aspect ratios
- Need consistent rendering across browsers
- Must provide a clean foundation for custom styling

Dependencies:
- Will be enqueued by functions.php
- Will be loaded before style.css, responsive.css, and carousel.css
- Should provide base styles that other stylesheets can build upon

Requirements for this file:
1. Create a modern CSS reset that:
   - Normalizes default styles across browsers
   - Removes unwanted margins, paddings, and borders
   - Sets up a consistent box-sizing model
   - Establishes proper baseline for typography
   - Handles form elements consistently
   - Provides accessible focus states
   - Fixes common browser inconsistencies
2. Include reset styles for:
   - HTML5 elements
   - Lists
   - Tables
   - Forms and form elements
   - Images and media
   - Links and buttons
3. Maintain accessibility features
4. Add comments explaining reset choices
5. Keep file size minimal for performance
6. Include only universal reset styles (not theme-specific styles)
7. Consider WordPress-specific elements like admin bar

Please create the complete reset.css file with detailed comments.
```

This prompt provides guidance for creating a CSS reset file that will ensure consistent rendering across browsers.
