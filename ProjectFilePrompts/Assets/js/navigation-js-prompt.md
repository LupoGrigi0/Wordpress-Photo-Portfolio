# Segment Prompt: navigation.js

```
I'm working on a custom WordPress theme for an art portfolio. We're building it in segments.

This segment focuses on: navigation.js

Project context:
- Custom theme with parallax scrolling effects
- Content blocks float over changing background images
- Navigation should fade in/out based on scroll position
- Need smooth navigation experience
- Must work well on mobile/tablet devices

Dependencies:
- Will be enqueued by functions.php
- Works with header.php navigation structure
- Should coordinate with parallax-scroll.js and dynamic-background.js

Requirements for this file:
1. Create functionality for:
   - Fading navigation in/out based on scroll position
   - Highlighting current section in navigation
   - Smooth scrolling to sections when navigation links are clicked
   - Mobile navigation toggle (hamburger menu)
   - Responsive behavior for different screen sizes
2. Include options for:
   - Fade timing and threshold customization
   - Scroll speed adjustment
   - Navigation style switching based on background content
3. Implement performance optimizations:
   - Throttled/debounced scroll event handling
   - Efficient DOM manipulation
   - Hardware-accelerated animations
4. Add proper event handling for:
   - Window resize
   - Device orientation change
   - Touch events on mobile
5. Include accessibility features:
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader support
   - Focus management
6. Add proper hooks for theme customization

Please create the complete navigation.js file with detailed comments.

This prompt provides guidance for creating the JavaScript that will handle the navigation behavior in your portfolio theme.
