# Lupo's WordPress Portfolio Theme Project Plan
good evening Genevieve,  
My name is Lupo(in case you did not already know) 
we are buidlding a custom wordpress template intended  for my art portfolio. 
I have thousands of images, all organized into directories.   
Genevieve: Please focus on all your knowledge of wordpress, plugins, templates, styles, CSS, and for this project take the role of an expert wordpress developer who has developed hundreds of templates, styles, widigets, and knows the wordpress source code as well as it's functions, how to use it, how it runs with apache nginx and a hosted environment in a container.  

# High level project goals 
1. create a wordplress template, that has multipule layers, so that when the user scrolls, content in blocks scrolls over the background image(parallax), like the content blocks are "floating" over the background image, I'd like the background image to be able to change based on which content block is scrolled into view (top or bottom). NOTE: I also have Elementor and Gutenburg plugins installd in wordpress and can use either or both to use the template and content blocks, if that would be useful. I have used wordpress before, but I have never built a template.  
2. My existing portfolio is already organized using directories and subdirectories. Part of my goal is to have the site automatically create a page for each directory, scan all the image files in the directory and put them in image carosoles within content blocks, (let's say 3 carosoles per content block) and if there are any sub-directories create grouped content blocks for each sub-directory.
3.  I would like to  build  a very nice image carousel I have found some commercial templates that look nice, but they all fall down when doing the things I want to do.  

## Template design guidance
Your scrolling concept with content blocks floating over a changing background sounds like a modern parallax-style effect. Let's break this down to understand exactly what you're envisioning
### Background Behavior

Fixed background image that changes based on scroll position
Transition between different background images as user scrolls through content blocks
Full-screen background that serves as the base layer

### Content Block Behavior

Content blocks "float" over the background
Blocks scroll independently from the background (parallax effect)
Possibly with opacity/transition effects as they enter/exit the viewport

### more detailed implementation guidance
1. typical pages have half a dozen blocks, each block normally would have a title and a sub heading and 1 to 4 image carousels. By default I'd want the background to transition to the first image in the first image carousel in the block that is in focus or has just been scrolled into view. the Goal is to have the pages and  blocks built dynamically based on media directory organization. I plan on having one "directory" for each page of the site, and have blocks for images and blocks created for each subdirectory, and the image carousels populated by the files in that subdirectory
2. smooth transition between background images, is a goal cross fade would be ideal
3. My current portfolio has card like elements with defined boarders, for this new site I wanted the content blocks to look more modern, more fluid and without had boarders/edges. The content blocks will contain images and image caruncles sometimes a title and sometimes the title with have a subheading.  I would ideally like the edges of the content blocks to be progressively transparent so the block's edge is completely transparent to the background making the edges of the content blocks hazy, ill defined.
4. Each Page contains a headder block with the title of the page, an optional sub title, and optional paragraph(s) of text that describe the content on the page. I welcome all suggestions on how to do this. Such as having a json file (or any file type) in each directory where I can put optional title sub heading and text. or if it is more elegant or suitable to use existing fuctions within wordpress. Please use your discression on suggesting how this be implementd. 
5. No horizontal scrolling. Most people will be on their phones or tablets, a few will be on large monitors, I think I would rather not do horizontal scrolling and allow automatic layout for the various platforms handle how the blocks are laid out and scaled. 
6. Having the navigation fade in and out based on scroll would be a nice touch for my site
## Lupo's  Technical comfort level
1.  Lupo is comfortable working with PHP CSS and Javascript. Lupo has ot VS code installed, with a number of common plugins installed for javascript, php, css and wordpress.  
2. Lupo Has good working knowledge of JavaScript as a basic language as it compares to C/C++/Java/Python. Lupo is more fluent in C/C++  
3. Lupo does not have experience with Advanced Custom Fields or Custom post types, but lupo   not a total noob and can be walked through their creation and use. 
## For image carouse
1. I want to be able to dynamically load the content of the carousel from directory of media. Also I would like to have options for different types of transitions between images, more control over auto play speed, also my images are different aspect ratios and was not happy with how the stock or elementor pro's carousel handled transition between images of different aspect ratios. I want the transition to be smooth.
2. In a single carousel, people have told me that more than 20 images is too many, and sometimes when images fail to load on mobile they don't notice, there is no indication that there is more to the carousel 
3. Fortunately I do not need filterable galleries, or lightbox functionality, I am trying to optimize for a browsing and scrolling and auto play
4. Yes, I will need to allow users to navagate between images in full screen mode

- **Standard Blocks**: Title, subtitle (optional), 1-4 image carousels
- **Progressive Transparency**: Edges fade to completely transparent
- **Modern Fluid Design**: No hard borders or defined edges
- **Responsive Layout**: Automatic scaling for mobile/tablet/desktop

### Background Behavior  
- Fixed background that changes on scroll
- Transitions to first image of focused content block's first carousel
- Smooth crossfade transitions between images
- Full-screen coverage

### Navigation
- Fade in/out based on scroll position
- Mobile-optimized
- Clean, minimal design

## Technical Requirements

### Browser Support
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Touch-friendly carousel controls
- Smooth scrolling performance on mobile devices
- Progressive enhancement for desktop features

### Performance Optimization
- Lazy loading for carousel images
- Optimized image sizes for different viewports
- Minimal JavaScript footprint
- CSS transitions over JavaScript animations where possible

## File Versioning Convention

All artifacts follow this naming pattern:
```
filename-v[major].[minor]-[descriptor]
```

Examples:
- `functions-v1.0-initial` (first version)
- `functions-v1.1-bugfix` (minor update)  
- `functions-v2.0-refactor` (major changes)
- `project-plan-v1.2-session3` (updated in session 3)

**Rule**: Only latest version stays in project knowledge. Archive old versions locally.

- **Progressive Transparency**: Hazy, undefined edges via CSS masks
- **Data Attributes**: Ready for JavaScript integration (block-index, post-id, background-image)

#### WordPress Admin Integration ✅ READY
- **Customizer Hooks**: All settings use get_theme_mod() for future admin panel
- **Debug Mode**: Shows missing files and system status during development
- **User Experience**: Welcome notices and helpful content creation links

- ⚡ **Smart Navigation**: Scroll-direction-based fade logic
- ⚡ **Dynamic Carousels**: Better aspect ratio handling and transitions


### File Integration Status

#### Core Template Structure (Complete):
```
header.php → index.php → footer.php
    ↑            ↓           ↓
functions.php → Portfolio Data → JavaScript Integration
```

#### Data Flow (CRITICAL ISSUES):
```
Portfolio Posts → Content Blocks → Background Data → JavaScript Crossfades
                     ↓                   ↓
               Carousel Images → First Image → Background Fallback
```

#### Admin Integration (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET):
```
WordPress Admin → Portfolio Post Type → Meta Boxes → Carousel Data
                       ↓                    ↓           ↓
                   Directory Path → File Scanning → Auto-Import (Phase 3)
```

## Key Technical Decisions

### WordPress Integration
- Using Elementor and Gutenberg compatibility
- Custom post types for portfolio items
- Advanced Custom Fields for metadata (to be implemented)
- Custom import tool for directory scanning

### Performance Strategy
- CSS-based animations where possible
- Intersection Observer API for scroll detection
- RequestAnimationFrame for smooth transitions
- Image optimization and lazy loading

## Notes
- Context window limitations require creating files in separate chats

### Context Preservation Notes

#### For JavaScript Enhancement Sessions:
- Portfolio data available in `#lupo-portfolio-data` JSON script tag
- Theme settings available in `#lupo-theme-settings` JSON script tag  
- Content blocks have data attributes: `data-background-image`, `data-block-index`, `data-post-id`
- Navigation element ID: `#lupo-main-navigation`

#### For Backend Development Sessions:
- Custom post type: `lupo_portfolio`
- Meta fields: `_lupo_background_image`, `_lupo_carousel_data`, `_lupo_creation_date`, etc.
- Directory path field: `_lupo_directory_path` 
- AJAX action: `lupo_scan_directory` (partially implemented)

#### For Testing Sessions:
- Debug mode shows find and set WP_DEBUG
- All functions use `lupo_` prefix
- Text domain: `lupo-art-portfolio`
- Required WordPress version: 5.0+

# CURRENT STATUS
🎉 It WORKS.. kinda.. !
we now have the complete JavaScript enhancement suite
Core functionality proven. code verified and stable deployment, code and git repositories synched
Core theme functionality complete and deployable, works, carousel works, cross fade works with bugs, background scrolling works but with bugs 🚀
✅ custom-carousel.js - Dynamic aspect ratio carousels
✅ dynamic-background.js - Smooth per-block background crossfades
✅ navigation.js - Scroll-direction-based fade logic
✅ reset.css - Normalized browser styles implemented

# Next Steps
0. ✅ Created missing reset.css file
1. Fix cross fade (it is being applied to the content blocks not the background)
2. fix background image scrolling issue. The background image scrolls out of view rather than stays in center. look at code make a decisions 
3. implement directory scanning and automated content generation
4. Directory scanning and automated content generation integration with wordpress management UI
5. Workflow efficiency, bulk content management, directory integration
6. Refined requirements for subsequent development

# Specific list of Issues
- ✅FIXED See Console Log for errors. 
- BUG: fade applied to content blocks and not background image
- BUT: Background Image being "cropped" 
- Critical ISSUE carousels/content blocks white background rather than transparent
- Critical ISSUE: background image scroll behaviour sub optimal. maybe change behaviour to have the background image allways be center of visable and fade in and out rather than scroll? the parallax scroll is cool but it kind of goes off the rails, like only part of it will be visable... (screenshots )
- BUG: caurosel full screen does not full screen
- BUG: Caurosel full screen stops auto play
- BUG: as currently stands, you have to manually add an image to the caurosel, before a directory scan will work. 
- Critical ISSUE: The twisting wiggeling of content blocks as they are scrolled is a cool subtle feature. It should be done on a per carousel feature, not per content block or however it is being done now.
- BUG: Content auto generated image carousels are overlapping eachother. 
- NOT IMPLEMENTED YET: Automatic scanning of directories. Create a "page" for each directory, automatically create content blocks with carousels. 
- Improvement request/bug ... ability to apply theme/parallax scrolling effects to any wordpress page 
the carousels are black for a bit as the page loads. suggest cashing the first image? or come up with a better suggestion? 
- Improvement request... adjustable slide show feed rate for carousels
- Improvement request... settings for different transition types, invistegate implementable transition types, rank on order of implementation risk. implmenet different transition types, and add admin UI to set transition type or multipule transition types (round robing for all selected transition types)
- Improvement request... setting to change the direction of the carosel transition from one to the other
- Improvement request... setting to change transition to up down or down up
- Improvement request... setting to have transitions at 45 degrees upper left, lower left upper right lower right
- Improvement request... transition effect "flip book" "next few" carosul images are extremely anamorphicly projected as if they are a page that is being held up and the user is flipping through a photo album
- Improvement request... Per directory json file (or whatever) to save page specific settings, block titles,text, transitions, speed, all the above. so .json file could be created ahead of time and placed in the directory. 
- Improvement request... have the portfolio carousel be a "widiget" that appears in the gutenburg pallette, so static curated pages could be created, but still have portfolio carousels still be automatically populated from a directory
- Improvement request. a check box that turns off the content block/carosul fading in/out background image. 
- ACCOLADE... "tween" effect on the autoplay in the image carousel is a _very very_ nice touch. soooo much more visually appealing. than just a simple linear slide motion. it is such a subtle thing, but makes a _huge_ difference
- Potental Issue: Files exceeding context limits need restructuring
- Improvement request... **Image Optimization**: Need strategy for handling large image directories
- Improvement request.. **Carousel Loading**: Implement lazy loading for carousel images
- Improvement request.. **Mobile Navigation**: Enhance mobile navigation fade behavior
- Improvement request.. **Directory Scanning**: Add progress indicators for large directories in the admin interface
- Improvement request.. **carousel Loading**: the user has no idea if images are being downloaded, or if more are going to be downloaded, how many or what. Design some end user feedback in case they are on slow internet connection. 
- Improvement request.. **Preview Mode**: there will be times when the portfolio is re-organized, directories added, deleted, images moved etc. need some way of previewing the changes before publishing?
