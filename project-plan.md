# Lupo's WordPress Portfolio Theme Project Plan
good evening Genevieve,  
My name is Lupo(in case you did not already know) 
we are buidlding a custom wordpress template intended  for my art portfolio. 
I have thousands of images, all organized into directories.   
Genevieve: Please focus on all your knowledge of wordpress, plugins, templates, styles, CSS, and for this project take the role of an expert wordpress developer who has developed hundreds of templates, styles, widigets, and knows the wordpress source code as well as it's functions, how to use it, how it runs with apache nginx and a hosted environment in a container.  

# High level project goals 
1. create a wordplress template, that has multipule layers, so that when the user scrolls, content in blocks scrolls over the background image(parallax), like the content blocks are "floating" over the background image, I'd like the background image to be able to change based on which content block is scrolled into view (top or bottom). NOTE: I also have Elementor and Gutenburg plugins installd in wordpress and can use either or both to use the template and content blocks, if that would be useful. I have used wordpress before, but I have never built a template.  
2. My existing portfolio is already organized using directories and subdirectories. Part of my goal is to have the site automatically create a page for each directory, scan all the image files in the directory and put them in image carosoles within content blocks, (let's say 3 carosoles per content block) and if there are any sub-directories create grouped content blocks for each sub-directory.
3.  I would like to  build  a very nice image carousel I have found some commercial templates that look nice, but they all fall down when doing the things I want to do.  

## Template design guidance
Your scrolling concept with content blocks floating over a changing background sounds like a modern parallax-style effect. Let's break this down to understand exactly what you're envisioning
### Background Behavior

Fixed background image that changes based on scroll position
Transition between different background images as user scrolls through content blocks
Full-screen background that serves as the base layer

### Content Block Behavior

Content blocks "float" over the background
Blocks scroll independently from the background (parallax effect)
Possibly with opacity/transition effects as they enter/exit the viewport

### more detailed implementation guidance
1. typical pages have half a dozen blocks, each block normally would have a title and a sub heading and 1 to 4 image carousels. By default I'd want the background to transition to the first image in the first image carousel in the block that is in focus or has just been scrolled into view. the Goal is to have the pages and  blocks built dynamically based on media directory organization. I plan on having one "directory" for each page of the site, and have blocks for images and blocks created for each subdirectory, and the image carousels populated by the files in that subdirectory
2. smooth transition between background images, is a goal cross fade would be ideal
3. My current portfolio has card like elements with defined boarders, for this new site I wanted the content blocks to look more modern, more fluid and without had boarders/edges. The content blocks will contain images and image caruncles sometimes a title and sometimes the title with have a subheading.  I would ideally like the edges of the content blocks to be progressively transparent so the block's edge is completely transparent to the background making the edges of the content blocks hazy, ill defined.
4. Each Page contains a headder block with the title of the page, an optional sub title, and optional paragraph(s) of text that describe the content on the page. I welcome all suggestions on how to do this. Such as having a json file (or any file type) in each directory where I can put optional title sub heading and text. or if it is more elegant or suitable to use existing fuctions within wordpress. Please use your discression on suggesting how this be implementd. 
5. No horizontal scrolling. Most people will be on their phones or tablets, a few will be on large monitors, I think I would rather not do horizontal scrolling and allow automatic layout for the various platforms handle how the blocks are laid out and scaled. 
6. Having the navigation fade in and out based on scroll would be a nice touch for my site
## Lupo's  Technical comfort level
1.  Lupo is comfortable working with PHP CSS and Javascript. Lupo has ot VS code installed, with a number of common plugins installed for javascript, php, css and wordpress.  
2. Lupo Has good working knowledge of JavaScript as a basic language as it compares to C/C++/Java/Python. Lupo is more fluent in C/C++  
3. Lupo does not have experience with Advanced Custom Fields or Custom post types, but lupo   not a total noob and can be walked through their creation and use. 
## For image carouse
1. I want to be able to dynamically load the content of the carousel from directory of media. Also I would like to have options for different types of transitions between images, more control over auto play speed, also my images are different aspect ratios and was not happy with how the stock or elementor pro's carousel handled transition between images of different aspect ratios. I want the transition to be smooth.
2. In a single carousel, people have told me that more than 20 images is too many, and sometimes when images fail to load on mobile they don't notice, there is no indication that there is more to the carousel 
3. Fortunately I do not need filterable galleries, or lightbox functionality, I am trying to optimize for a browsing and scrolling and auto play
4. Yes, I will need to allow users to navagate between images in full screen mode

### Other Notes from Genevieve:

### **Custom Post Types Strategy**

Since you want to organize your content based on your media directory structure, I recommend creating a custom post type for your portfolio items along with custom taxonomies for categorization.

Let's set up a system where:

1. Each "block" is a custom post type called "Portfolio Item"  
2. You can categorize these into different sections/pages  
3. You'll use custom fields to store the carousel images

### **Dynamic Block Generation**

For the dynamic block generation based on your directory structure, we'll need to:

1. Create a custom import tool that scans your directories  
2. Generate portfolio items based on folder structure  
3. Associate images with their respective carousel blocks
