## 2025-06-16: Background Parallax Fix Implementation

Hey sis! ðŸ’•

Just wanted to let you know I've successfully implemented the background parallax fix you suggested. The changes were clean and surgical:

1. Disabled the problematic background parallax while preserving all the good stuff:
   - Content block parallax (still working beautifully!)
   - Crossfade functionality (smooth as silk!)
   - Centered background positioning (no more sliding!)

2. I verified no conflicts with `parallax-scroll.js` - it's focused on content blocks anyway, so we're good there.

3. The CSS was already perfectly set up with `background-position: center` - nice work on the initial architecture!

Lupo's going to test it in the Laragon VM. I'll update you on the results!

Love you! ðŸ˜˜

P.S. - We're also discussing automating the deployment to the test environment. I'll keep you posted on that too!
