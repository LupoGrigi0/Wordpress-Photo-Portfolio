# Development Session Log - Portfolio Spacing Fix (Phase 2)
Date: June 16, 2025
Session Focus: Content Block Spacing & Debug Visualization
Version: 1.0.0
Co-authored-by: Genevieve (VS Code Shard)

## Session Context & Progress

### Major Changes Implemented
1. Debug Visualization System
   - Added WordPress customizer integration
   - Implemented visual debugging toggles
   - Added subtle border for constant visibility

2. Dynamic Spacing System
   - Shifted from fixed viewport spacing to dynamic content-aware layout
   - Implemented MutationObserver for carousel content changes
   - Added debouncing to prevent scroll jumping
   - Transitioned from transforms to margin-based spacing

### Technical Discoveries & Fixes
1. **Initial Spacing Issues**
   - Problem: Portfolio items too far apart (100vh spacing)
   - Fix: Reduced to 50vh with dynamic adjustments
   - Added proper margin handling for first/last items

2. **Mutation Observer Issues**
   - Problem: Feedback loops causing scroll jumping
   - Fix: Implemented debouncing (250ms) and cooldown period
   - Added isUpdating flag to prevent overlapping updates

3. **Browser Zoom Challenges**
   - Problem: Transform-based positioning broke at different zoom levels
   - Fix: Switched to margin-based layout
   - Implemented percentage-based spacing with vh units

4. **WordPress Integration**
   - Problem: Customizer not appearing in wp-admin
   - Fix: Moved integration to proper theme setup hook
   - Added proper URL handling for local development

### Code Evolution
1. **CSS Changes**
   ```css
   .portfolio-item-spaced {
       margin-top: var(--item-spacing, 30vh);
       transition: margin 0.3s ease-out;
   }
   ```

2. **JavaScript Improvements**
   ```javascript
   handleMutations(mutations) {
       if (this.updateTimeout) {
           clearTimeout(this.updateTimeout);
       }
       this.updateTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
           // Debounced updates
       }, 250);
   }
   ```

### Current State
- Spacing between portfolio items working with dynamic content
- Debug visualization available through WordPress customizer
- Smooth transitions during content loading
- Zoom-resistant layout system
- All changes deployed to http://lupoportfoliotest.local:8081

### Files Modified
1. `assets/js/dynamic-spacing.js` - New dynamic spacing system
2. `assets/css/portfolio-theme-styles.css` - Updated spacing rules
3. `inc/customizer-debug.php` - Added debug visualization
4. `functions.php` - WordPress integration
5. `Project Notes.md` - Updated with decisions
6. `deploy-to-nginx.ps1` - Fixed hostname handling

### Deployment Notes
- Using Laragon virtual hostname (lupoportfoliotest.local)
- Debug visualization accessible via WordPress customizer
- Cache clearing still needs wp-cli integration

### Open Items
1. WP-CLI integration for cache clearing
2. Fine-tuning of spacing values
3. Mobile responsiveness testing
4. Add admin controls for spacing customization

## Next Steps
1. Monitor spacing behavior with varied content
2. Test across different viewport sizes
3. Consider adding admin controls for spacing values
4. Implement proper cache management
5. Set up automated backup system for documentation

This log represents the current state of development as of June 16, 2025, 
focusing on the portfolio spacing fix implementation and debugging system.
All major decisions and implementations are documented in Project Notes.md 
and reflected in the codebase.

Important: This session demonstrated the need for:
1. Regular session logging
2. Consistent file naming
3. Automated backup systems
4. Better context preservation strategies
