# Segment Prompt: style.css

```
I'm working on a custom WordPress theme for an art portfolio. We're building it in segments.

This segment focuses on: style.css

Project context:
- Custom theme with parallax scrolling effects
- Content blocks float over changing background images
- Content blocks should have progressively transparent edges
- Custom image carousel that handles different aspect ratios
- Need to support thousands of images in an organized portfolio
- Must work well on mobile/tablet devices

Dependencies:
- Will be enqueued by functions.php
- Contains theme identification header
- Works alongside reset.css, responsive.css, and carousel.css
- Styles elements created by various template files

Requirements for this file:
1. Include proper WordPress theme header with:
   - Theme Name, URI, Description, Author, Version
   - License information
   - Text domain for translations
   - Required WordPress version
   - Tags for theme directory
2. Create base styles for:
   - Typography (headings, paragraphs, lists, links)
   - Layout and grid system
   - Color scheme and variables
   - Content blocks with transparent edges
   - Background image containers
3. Style theme components:
   - Header and navigation
   - Footer
   - Portfolio content areas
   - Content block containers
   - Parallax elements
4. Include proper CSS variables for theme customization
5. Add base responsive design rules (major breakpoints)
6. Include proper commenting for sections
7. Add print styles if relevant
8. Optimize for performance

Note: Specific carousel styles will be in carousel.css, and detailed responsive rules in responsive.css

Please create the complete style.css file with detailed comments.

This prompt provides guidance for creating the main stylesheet for your portfolio theme, focusing on the core theme styles rather than component-specific styles.
