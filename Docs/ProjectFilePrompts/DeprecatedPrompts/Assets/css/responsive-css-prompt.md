# Segment Prompt: responsive.css

```
I'm working on a custom WordPress theme for an art portfolio. We're building it in segments.

This segment focuses on: responsive.css

Project context:
- Custom theme with parallax scrolling effects
- Content blocks float over changing background images
- Custom image carousel that handles different aspect ratios
- Most users will be on phones or tablets, some on large monitors
- Need to optimize visual experience across all devices
- No horizontal scrolling desired

Dependencies:
- Will be enqueued by functions.php
- Works alongside style.css and carousel.css
- Should coordinate with responsive JavaScript behavior

Requirements for this file:
1. Create responsive styles for:
   - Mobile devices (portrait and landscape)
   - Tablets (portrait and landscape)
   - Laptops/desktops (various screen sizes)
   - Large/ultra-wide monitors
2. Include media queries for:
   - Different screen widths
   - Different device orientations
   - Different pixel densities
3. Adjust layout for:
   - Content block positioning and size
   - Typography scaling
   - Image sizing and positioning
   - Navigation display and behavior
   - Parallax effect intensity
   - Element spacing and margins
4. Implement progressive enhancement:
   - Core content accessible on all devices
   - Enhanced features for capable devices
   - Fallbacks for older browsers
5. Include print styles if relevant
6. Optimize for performance across devices
7. Use proper namespacing to avoid conflicts
8. Add accessibility considerations for different devices

Please create the complete responsive.css file with detailed comments.
