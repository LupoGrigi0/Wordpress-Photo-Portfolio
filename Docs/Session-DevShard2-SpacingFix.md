# Development Session Log - Portfolio Spacing Fix
Date: June 16, 2025
Session Focus: Content Block Spacing & Debug Visualization
Version: 1.0.0
Co-authored-by: Genevieve (VS Code Shard)

## Session Context & Progress

### Major Changes Implemented
1. Debug Visualization System
   - Added WordPress customizer integration
   - Implemented visual debugging toggles
   - Added subtle border for constant visibility

2. Dynamic Spacing System
   - Shifted from fixed viewport spacing to dynamic content-aware layout
   - Implemented MutationObserver for carousel content changes
   - Added debouncing to prevent scroll jumping
   - Transitioned from transforms to margin-based spacing

### Technical Discoveries
1. **Mutation Observer Issues**
   - Initial implementation caused feedback loops
   - Fixed with debouncing (250ms) and cooldown period
   - Added isUpdating flag to prevent overlapping updates

2. **Browser Zoom Challenges**
   - Transform-based positioning caused issues with zoom levels
   - Switched to margin-based layout for better zoom handling
   - Implemented percentage-based spacing with vh units

3. **WordPress Integration**
   - Customizer API integration for debug controls
   - Cache clearing considerations documented
   - Proper timing for theme setup hooks

### Current State
- Spacing between portfolio items working with dynamic content
- Debug visualization available through WordPress customizer
- Smooth transitions during content loading
- Zoom-resistant layout system

### Deployment Status
- Theme deployed to http://lupoportfoliotest.local:8081
- Debug visualization accessible via customizer
- All changes committed and documented

### Open Items
1. WP-CLI integration for cache clearing
2. Fine-tuning of spacing values
3. Mobile responsiveness testing

### Files Modified
1. `assets/js/dynamic-spacing.js`
2. `assets/css/portfolio-theme-styles.css`
3. `inc/customizer-debug.php`
4. `functions.php`
5. `Project Notes.md`

## Technical Implementation Details

### Debug Visualization
```css
:root {
    --debug-block-opacity: 0;
    /* Set to 0.1 for debugging */
}
```

### Dynamic Spacing
```javascript
handleMutations(mutations) {
    if (this.updateTimeout) {
        clearTimeout(this.updateTimeout);
    }
    this.updateTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
        // Updates here
    }, 250);
}
```

## Next Steps
1. Monitor spacing behavior with varied content
2. Test across different viewport sizes
3. Consider adding admin controls for spacing values
4. Implement proper cache management
