# Segment Prompt: template-parts/content-block.php

```
I'm working on a custom WordPress theme for an art portfolio. We're building it in segments.

This segment focuses on: template-parts/content-block.php

Project context:
- Custom theme with parallax scrolling effects
- Content blocks float over changing background images
- Each block contains a title, optional subheading, and 1-4 image carousels
- Blocks should have progressively transparent edges
- Blocks are generated based on portfolio custom post types
- Need to work well on mobile/tablet devices
- Need to integrate with the parallax scrolling system

Dependencies:
- Will be included in page.php and index.php templates
- Will use carousel.php for rendering carousels
- Relies on data structure from custom-post-types.php
- Will be targeted by parallax-scroll.js for scroll effects
- Will use styling from portfolio-theme-style.css

Requirements for this file:
1. Create a template part that:
   - Renders a single portfolio content block
   - Displays title and optional subheading
   - Includes proper containers for 1-4 carousels
   - Uses proper data attributes for parallax effects
   - Works with the dynamic background system
2. Include proper markup for:
   - Progressive transparency at block edges
   - Responsive layout
   - Proper spacing and positioning
3. Add appropriate WordPress template tags
4. Include conditional logic for different block layouts
5. Add proper hooks for theme customization
6. Include accessibility attributes

Please create the complete template-parts/content-block.php file with detailed comments.

This prompt provides guidance for creating the template part that will render each floating content block in your portfolio.
