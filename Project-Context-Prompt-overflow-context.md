# Project introduction and Discussion:

###  Lupo: 

good evening Genevieve,   
I am trying to build a wordpress site for my art portfolio. I have thousands of images, all organized into directories.   
Please focus on all your knowledge of wordpress, plugins, templates, styles, CSS, and for this chat take the role of an expert wordpress developer who has developed hundreds of templates, styles, widigets, and knows the wordpress source code as well as it's functions, how to use it, how it runs with apache nginx and a hosted environment in a container.   
I would like to do 2 things   
1: create a template, that has multipule layers, so that when the user scrolls, content in blocks scrolls over the background image, like the content blocks are "floating" over the background image, I'd like the background image to be able to change based on which content block is scrolled into view (top or bottom) I also have Elementor and Gutenburg plugins installd in wordpress and can use either or both to create my pages. I have used wordpress before, but I have never built a template.  
 2:After the template is created I would like to either find, or build from source a very nice image carousel I have found some commercial templates that look nice, but they all fall down when doing the things I want to do.  
Can we start with a discussion about what I want my template to look like, and how I want it to work, and how I want to be able to use the template?

### Genevieve:

Good evening\! I'd be happy to help you build a WordPress portfolio site that showcases your art effectively. Let's start by discussing your template vision and then move on to the image carousel requirements.  
Template Discussion  
Your scrolling concept with content blocks floating over a changing background sounds like a modern parallax-style effect. Let's break this down to understand exactly what you're envisioning:  
Background Behavior

Fixed background image that changes based on scroll position  
Transition between different background images as user scrolls through content blocks  
Full-screen background that serves as the base layer

Content Block Behavior

Content blocks "float" over the background  
Blocks scroll independently from the background (parallax effect)  
Possibly with opacity/transition effects as they enter/exit the viewport

Questions to clarify your vision:

How many different background images do you want to cycle through in a typical page?  
Do you want smooth transitions between background images or instant switches?  
For the floating content blocks, are you thinking of card-like elements with defined borders or more fluid content sections?  
Would you like the option to have text directly on the background in some sections?  
Are you looking for horizontal scrolling in any sections, or is this all vertical scrolling?  
Would you like the navigation to be visible at all times or have it appear/disappear based on scroll?

Let's also discuss your technical comfort level:

Are you comfortable working directly with PHP, CSS, and JavaScript files?  
Would you prefer to build this through a child theme of an existing theme or create something from scratch?  
Do you have experience with Advanced Custom Fields or Custom Post Types?

For your image carousel needs, I'll need to understand:

What specifically are commercial carousels lacking for your needs?  
How many images do you typically want to display in a single carousel?  
Do you need features like filterable galleries or lightbox functionality?  
Would you want users to be able to navigate between images in fullscreen mode?

### The more details you can provide about your vision, the better I can guide you through building a template that meets your exact needs.  Lupo:

Excellent I'm glad to be working with you, here are my answers to your questions.  
1\. typical pages have half a dozen blocks, each block normally would have a title and a sub heading and 1 to 4 image carousels. By default I'd want the background to transition to the first image in the first image carousel in the block that is in focus or has just been scrolled into view. Ideally I would want the blocks built dynamically based on media directory organization. I plan on having one "directory" for each page of the site, and have blocks created for each subdirectory, and the image caruncles populated by the files in that subdirectory  
2\. yes smooth transition between background images, cross fade would be ideal  
3\. My current portfolio has card like elements with defined boarders, for this new site I wanted the content blocks to look more modern, more fluid and without had boarders/edges. The content blocks will contain images and image caruncles sometimes a title and sometimes the title with have a subheading.  I would ideally like the edges of the content blocks to be progressively transparent so the block's edge is completely transparent to the background making the edges of the content blocks hazy, ill defined.  
4\. Yes  
5\. No horizontal scrolling. Most people will be on their phones or tablets, a few will be on large monitors, I think I would rather not do horizontal scrolling and allow automatic layout for the various platforms handle how the blocks are laid out and scaled.   
6\. Having the navigation fade in and out based on scroll would be a nice touch for my site  
Technical comfort level  
1\. Yes I'm comfortable working with PHP CSS and Javascript. I've got VS code installed, if there are any helpful VS code plugins you would recommend for this project I would welcome the suggestions. I have good working knowledge of JavaScript as a basic language as it compares to C/C++/Java/Python. I am more fluent in C/C++   
2\. I would prefer to create from scratch, but if you know of a stable, open source, theme that has features that would make this project easier to get going, I am open to suggestions.   
3\. No I do not have experience with Advanced Custom Fields or Custom post types, but I'm also not a total noob and can be walked through their creation and use.   
For image carousel   
1\. For example Elementor pro. I want to be able to dynamically load the content of the carousel from a specific directory of media. Also I would like to have options for different types of transitions between images, more control over auto play speed, also my images are different aspect ratios and was not happy with how the stock or elementor pro's carousel handled transition between images of different aspect ratios. I want the transition to be smooth.  
2\. In a single carousel, people have told me that more than 20 images is too many, and sometimes when images fail to load on mobile they don't notice, there is no indication that there is more to the carousel   
3\. Fortunately I do not need filterable galleries, or lightbox functionality, I am trying to optimize for a browsing and scrolling and auto play  
4\. Yes, I will need to allow users to navagate between images in full screen mode

### Genevieve:

## **Theme Development Approach**

Given your comfort with PHP, CSS, and JavaScript, I recommend building a custom theme from scratch. This will give you complete control over the structure and interactions.

### **VS Code Plugins for WordPress Development**

Here are some VS Code plugins that will make your WordPress development more efficient:

1. **PHP Intelephense** \- Superior PHP code intelligence  
2. **WordPress Snippets** \- Helpful WordPress code snippets  
3. **ESLint** \- JavaScript linting  
4. **Sass** \- For better CSS organization (if you decide to use SCSS)  
5. **Emmet** \- For faster HTML/CSS coding  
6. **PHP Debug** \- Helpful for troubleshooting  
7. **GitLens** \- Track changes if you're using Git

### **Theme Structure Plan**

Let's outline the basic structure for your custom theme:

`Lupos-portfolio-theme/`  
`├── assets/`  
`│   ├── css/`  
`│   ├── js/`  
`│   └── images/`  
`├── inc/`  
`│   ├── custom-post-types.php`  
`│   ├── template-functions.php`  
`│   ├── customizer.php`  
`│   └── carousel-functions.php`  
`├── template-parts/`  
`│   ├── content-block.php`  
`│   └── carousel.php`  
`├── functions.php`  
`├── header.php`  
`├── footer.php`  
`├── index.php`  
`├── single.php`  
`├── page.php`  
`├── style.css`  
`└── screenshot.png`

### Genevieve:

### **Custom Post Types Strategy**

Since you want to organize your content based on your media directory structure, I recommend creating a custom post type for your portfolio items along with custom taxonomies for categorization.

Let's set up a system where:

1. Each "block" is a custom post type called "Portfolio Item"  
2. You can categorize these into different sections/pages  
3. You'll use custom fields to store the carousel images

### **Dynamic Block Generation**

For the dynamic block generation based on your directory structure, we'll need to:

1. Create a custom import tool that scans your directories  
2. Generate portfolio items based on folder structure  
3. Associate images with their respective carousel blocks

## **Parallax Floating Block Implementation**

For the parallax effect with floating content blocks over changing backgrounds:

Now, let's look at the custom image carousel implementation that addresses your specific needs:
