# Segment Prompt: custom-post-types.php

```
I'm working on a custom WordPress theme for an art portfolio. We're building it in segments.

This segment focuses on: custom-post-types.php

Project context:
- Custom theme with parallax scrolling effects
- Content blocks float over changing background images
- Custom image carousel that handles different aspect ratios
- Dynamic block generation based on media directory structure
- Each "block" represents an art project/collection
- Need to organize thousands of images into manageable portfolio items

Requirements for this file:
1. Create a custom post type called "Portfolio" for art projects
2. Create custom taxonomies for categorizing portfolio items (e.g., medium, subject, year)
3. Add custom meta boxes for:
   - Background image selection
   - Project details (description, creation date, etc.)
   - Directory path for image loading
4. Register necessary meta fields for storing image carousel data
5. Include appropriate labels and UI text
6. Set up admin columns for better organization in the dashboard

The custom post type should support:
- Featured images
- Custom attributes
- Hierarchical organization
- Custom permalinks structure
- Integration with existing WordPress UI

Please create the complete custom-post-types.php file with detailed comments.
```

This prompt provides all the necessary context for creating the custom post types file, which will establish the foundation for how content is organized in the portfolio theme.
